## Time Series Forecasting

Dataset: [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy)

The objective is to train tree different models for a forecasting task on the selected time series dataset:
1. A classical model for time series data such as ARIMA
2. Perform data transformation and train an MLP, linear regressor, random forest model for regression...
3. Train a Deep-Learning model to perform the forecasting task

Finally a comparison between all the models will be performed.
